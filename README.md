# markdownDbUnit

This repository is markdown's extension for [DbUnit](http://dbunit.sourceforge.net/).

# Motivation

Why I made markdown's extention?  
It is a simple reason.  
Markdown has high affinity with GitHub!!  

GitHub supports markdown in high level.  
If your project has many test data's files for testing and your service's enhancement will change the files drasticly,
then, you want to see the differences betweens new and old files.  
Is it convinience to see the differences as follows!?

That's the reason!
